🤔 WHAT ARE THESE MYSTERIOUS PARTS?
===================================

You asked the PERFECT question! Let me explain each one like you're 5 years old.
NO fancy programming terms, just simple explanations!

Remember: You already understand inputs, weights, and threshold.
These 4 new things are just EXTRAS that help the perceptron LEARN!

print("❌ McCulloch-Pitts: weights = [3, 1] FOREVER (never change)")
print("✅ Perceptron: weights start as None, then LEARN the best values!")
print()
print("Real example:")
print("You're learning what makes a good pizza:")
print("Day 1: You think cheese=5, sauce=2 (your guess)")
print("Day 2: You try pizza, it's bad! Adjust: cheese=3, sauce=4")

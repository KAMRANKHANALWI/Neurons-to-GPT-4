üîí LSTM MATH: Super Simple 8th Grade Version!
============================================

Let's understand LSTM math with:
- Simple numbers (no scary decimals!)
- Easy examples (like deciding what to eat)
- Step-by-step calculations
- Visual analogies

Then we'll reveal the real complex math! üìö

## üß† The Quantum Physics Parallel

Just like in quantum physics:

- **Each "wrong" model teaches essential principles**
- **Mathematical foundations build upon each other**
- **Implementation reveals deep insights theory alone cannot**
- **Understanding the journey makes the destination intuitive**

By the end, transformers won't feel like magic - they'll feel like the natural evolution of everything you've learned, just like quantum mechanics feels natural once you understand atomic theory.
